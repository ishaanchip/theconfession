       <h1>Through Christ Alone</h1>
<p>Humans are wicked, evil beings; doomed to utter destruction. We need to be saved. But why is salvation only found through Jesus Christ? Well Jesus Himself stated <strong><em>“‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.From now on you do know him and have seen him’” (John 14:6-7).</strong></em> Paul writes <strong><em>“the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord’”</strong></em> (Romans 6:23). John also notes <strong><em>“whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son. And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life”</strong></em> (1 John 5: 10-12). God is holy and pure. God despises and hates sin. He cannot stand its presence. Sin strains the relationship between man and God; it separates the Creator from His creation. God cannot pass over man’s sin, for He is a righteous Judge. Sin is an abomination that needs to be punished. So, Jesus, being the One Mediator between God and humanity-fully man, fully God- sacrificed Himself on the cross, being the perfect offering. He bore the full wrath of God upon Himself so that we do not have to. The only way there is salvation is when sin is atoned for. The wages of sin is death as Paul stated, and Christ took on death that our sin may be passed over. Christ’s death shows us the severity of sin, being that the only way for it to be paid for  meant destruction upon the perfect Lamb; the One who was unblemished. <strong><em>“He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.  When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.  He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.  For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls” </strong></em>(1 Peter 2: 22-25). Our sin was fully atoned for in Christ; we are covered in His blood. We are now seen in the eyes of God as holy and pure because of Jesus’ sacrifice. No other religion provides true salvation because there is no atonement for sin and is dependent on man’s labor for eternal life. In Christianity we are not saved by our own merit, works or who we are as people, but by the love and grace of our God and His sacrifice. We can do absolutely nothing in our own power and might have to pay for the price of our sin. We need the One who is sinless, the One who is all-mighty and all-powerful, to deal with our sin. </p>

<h1>Suffering in World & God’s Righteousness</h1> 
<p>One reason why many people cannot accept the God of the Bible is because the Bible states that He is perfect, holy, righteous and love itself. Then, they look at the state of the world today.  They see the children suffering and even dying of horrid conditions like starvation, assault, and cancerous tumors. They see the widowed and orphaned, and their great suffering. They see the family who lost their child to disease. They look to the evil in the world around them and they think there cannot possibly be a God that is Sovereign  in control of this world when such terrible things occur. Or, they think there cannot be a God who claims to be the very essence of love in control. How can such terrible events occur to those who are innocent like children, or how can someone who seems to not deserve such evil against them receive it? How can there possibly be an all-mighty, just, loving Creator if there is so much injustice in the world? </p>
	<p>Other religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Janiasm chalk up the evil and disasters in the world due to karma: ‘If you did evil in a previous life or in your current life, you will receive evil and disastrous things in your life to come. If you did good in a previous life or in your current life, you will receive good and joyful things in your life to come’ . In this belief, you get what you deserve. In the Biblical sense, the principle of ‘getting what you deserve’ is apparent in our lives to a certain degree, <strong><em>“Don’t be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a person sows he will also reap, because the one who sows to his flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit. Let us not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don’t give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us work for the good of all, especially for those who belong to the household of faith”</strong></em>(Galatians 6: 7-10). God encourages us to live godly, moral lives as there are consequences for our actions. However, the world does not always abide by these principles. We are not always treated as our actions always deserve. There are tyrannous, murderous, oppressive individuals who seem to be living a great, luxurious life. Take for instance Kim Jong Un: the oppressive world leader who leaves his people in the midst of poverty, takes away their basic rights, and orders that he be worshiped as some god. While the North Korean people are suffering, he is living his best life: driving the fanciest cars, eating the best foods, and living in mansions. Worst of all, he gives visiting reporters a false illusion when they travel and look around North Korea to give the appearance of a free, joyful, and thriving state. He knows how terrible the condition of the state is, so he hides it from the public. If we take a look back at the history of the world, there are a plethora of documents concerning evil rulers who oppressed the poor, and lived great, extravagant lives . In our world, the rich get richer, and the poor continuously reside in poverty. The rich acquire their wealth by taking advantage of others and deceiving the people closest to them. In a world that is supposedly run by the law of karma and the energy generated by it, shouldn’t these evil, wicked people be dealt with accordingly? Why is it that it is sometimes the six year old with the brain tumor and not the evil oppressor? Why are the seemingly good sometimes dealt with misfortune, whilst the evil one lives a harmonious life? To partially answer this question, we can look to God’s grace: <strong><em>“Dear friends, don’t overlook this one fact: With the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day. The Lord does not delay his promise, as some understand delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance” </strong></em>(2 Peter 3: 8-9). The God of the Bible is a gracious, merciful God who gives His creation the ability to turn from their former ways of evil. God gives grace to those whom He chooses to give grace to. This is perfectly demonstrated in one of Jesus’ parables: There was a land owner who hired five different men, at five different times of the day to work his land. They all worked different hours, and when the day had come to a close, the landowner called the men to give them their pay: <strong><em>“‘When those who were hired about five came, they each received one denarius.  So when the first ones came, they assumed they would get more, but they also received a denarius each. When they received it, they began to complain to the landowner: ‘These last men put in one hour, and you made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day’s work and the burning heat.’He replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I’m doing you no wrong. Didn’t you agree with me on a denarius?  Take what’s yours and go. I want to give this last man the same as I gave you. Don’t I have the right to do what I want with what is mine? Are you jealous because I’m generous’”</strong></em>(Matthew 20: 9-15)? God may be more gracious to some in a certain area or aspect than He may be to others. However, this does not make Him unfair because He chooses this: God’s grace is not something we earn; we do not deserve God’s grace. Let us not forget, however, that the wicked oppressor may live a life of luxury and prosperity here on Earth, they are simultaneously reaping eternal condemnation by their wicked acts: <strong><em>“Come now, you rich people, weep and wail over the miseries that are coming on you.  Your wealth has rotted and your clothes are moth-eaten.Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up treasure in the last days. Look! The pay that you withheld from the workers who mowed your fields cries out, and the outcry of the harvesters has reached the ears of the Lord of Armies. You have lived luxuriously on the earth and have indulged yourselves. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. You have condemned, you have murdered the righteous, who does not resist you”</strong></em>(James 5: 1-6).  We need to have an eternal perspective to make any sense of why good happens to bad and bad happens to good. This Earth has been corrupted by sin; injustice runs rampant on our planet. However, the time we have on this Earth is quite literally a blink of an eye compared to eternity. The wicked, unrepentant, evil human will see eternal fires and punishment for their sin; justice will be executed upon them. Maybe not right now here on this Earth, but it is surely coming. God will not let sin go unaccounted for. </p>

<p>Now, let’s look at those who seem not to deserve the hardship they are facing. When Jesus is with His disciples, they come across a blind man from birth. The disciples came to the definite conclusion that it was surely because of his, or his parents' sin that he was born blind. However, Jesus is quick to rebuke this train of thought, <strong><em>“‘Neither this man nor his parents sinned,’ Jesus answered. ‘This came about so that God’s works might be displayed in him. We must do the works of him who sent me while it is day. Night is coming when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.’ After he said these things he spit on the ground, made some mud from the saliva, and spread the mud on his eyes.  ‘Go,’ he told him, ‘wash in the pool of Siloam’(which means ‘Sent’). So he left, washed, and came back seeing. His neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar said, “Isn’t this the one who used to sit begging?”  Some said, “He’s the one.” Others were saying, ; ‘No, but he looks like him.’ He kept saying, ‘I’m the one. So they asked him, ‘Then how were your eyes opened?’ He answered, ‘The man called Jesus made mud, spread it on my eyes, and told me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ So when I went and washed I received my sight’” </strong></em>(John 9: 3-11). The seemingly blameless may suffer, so that God’s name may be glorified and exalted. Jesus uses the man’s blindness for His exaltation as He was able to showcase His miraculous power and is able to use the blind man to spread the Word of God. While this was occurring, the blind man was able to be led to the truth, being Jesus Chirst. In this case, the suffering that was faced led to good. However, this still leaves one aspect unaccounted for: how about the suffering of those who appear to be blameless, in which the suffering does not lead to apparent good? What about the six year old child who is plagued with cancerous tumors, who might die a terrible, painful death? When there cannot possibly be any good to come out of the situation, why does God let these things happen?</p>
<p>In an attempt to answer that question, let’s look at the book of Job. Job was a man who had everything: <strong><em>“There was a man in the country of Uz named Job. He was a man of complete integrity, who feared God and turned away from evil. He had seven sons and three daughters. His estate included seven thousand sheep and goats, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large number of servants. Job was the greatest man among all the people of the east” </strong></em>(Job 1:1-3).  Job had everything and was declared  an upright man, even by the assessment of God. So, Satan enters into heaven, where God resides, and Satan makes an interesting request. <strong><em>“‘Does Job fear God for nothing? Haven’t you placed a hedge around him, his household, and everything he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But stretch out your hand and strike everything he owns, and he will surely curse you to your face.’ ‘Very well,’ the Lord told Satan, ‘everything he owns is in your power. However, do not lay a hand on Job himself.’ So Satan left the Lord’s presence”</strong></em> (Job 1: 9-12). Satan claims that Job will certainly curse and hate God if his life's turned upside down. As of this point in the story, Job has faced zero misfortune or adversity, so of course he would praise God right in his amazing, prosperous living, right? That is definitely what Satan believes. He claims that if everything was taken away from Job, he would surely turn from God. So, God complies to the terms of Satan to see whether or not Job would stand faithful. <strong><em>“One day when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, a messenger came to Job and reported, ‘While the oxen were plowing and the donkeys grazing nearby, the Sabeans swooped down and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!’ He was still speaking when another messenger came and reported, ‘God’s fire fell from heaven. It burned the sheep and the servants and devoured them, and I alone have escaped to tell you!’That messenger was still speaking when yet another came and reported, ‘The Chaldeans formed three bands, made a raid on the camels, and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!’He was still speaking when another messenger came and reported, ‘Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house. Suddenly a powerful wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people so that they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you!’ Then Job stood up, tore his robe, and shaved his head. He fell to the ground and worshiped,  saying: ‘Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will leave this life. The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.’ Throughout all this Job did not sin or blame God for anything” </strong></em>(Job 1: 13-22). God allows these terrible evils to come about into Job’s life, and yet Job has no desire in his heart to curse God. He stood firm, even in the midst of these catastrophic events. However, he is not without grief and suffering: <strong><em>“May the day I was born perish, and the night that said, ‘A boy is conceived.’ If only that day had turned to darkness! May God above not care about it, or light shine on it. May darkness and gloom reclaim it, and a cloud settle over it. May what darkens the day terrify it” </strong></em>(Job 3: 3-5). He is so grief-stricken by what has happened to his life that he wishes he never had to endure this pain, and thought it would have been best if  he would have never been born and entered this world. After his lamenting, Job yearns to know why these terrible events were happening to him. Job demands that God answers his pleadings and questions as to why this suffering is upon him; he has acted in complete uprightness, right? So, God, after hearing all of Job’s words of despair and requests, calls to Job. <strong><em>“The Lord answered Job from the whirlwind. He said: Who is this who obscures my counsel with ignorant words? Get ready to answer me like a man; when I question you, you will inform me” </strong></em>(Job 38: 1-3). God speaks to Job about the world, the universe, and all of creation. For example, God inquired Job on <strong><em>“who put wisdom in the heart or gave the mind understanding?Who has the wisdom to number the clouds?Or who can tilt the water jars of heaven” </strong></em>(Job 38: 36-37). God wants Job to answer <strong><em>“have you traveled to the sources of the sea or walked in the depths of the oceans? Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Have you seen the gates of deep darkness? Have you comprehended the extent of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this” </strong></em>(Job 38: 16-18).God asks Job <strong><em>“do you give strength to the horse? Do you adorn his neck with a mane? Do you make him leap like a locust? His proud snorting fills one with terror. He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength; he charges into battle.  He laughs at fear, since he is afraid of nothing; he does not run from the sword. A quiver rattles at his side, along with a flashing spear and a javelin. He charges ahead with trembling rage; he cannot stand still at the sound of the ram’s horn. When the ram’s horn blasts, he snorts defiantly. He smells the battle from a distance; he hears the officers’ shouts and the battle cry”</strong></em> (Job 39:19-25).  Can we comprehend the clouds in the sky? Do we have control over the waters? Can we possibly fathom the glory of a horse, and how and why it acts in the way it does? How is it so bold and willing to fight anything in its path? Who designed the horse to look so frightening and glorious with its mane and stature? Who can possibly make such a glorious, unique creature? Who can make something as beautiful and useful as the clouds? Who can construct the world so that human life may thrive? God in His full wisdom can! God is glorious; He is great. After Job received this revelation,  he bowed in submission to God:  <strong><em>“Then Job replied to the Lord: I know that you can do anything and no plan of yours can be thwarted. You asked, ‘Who is this who conceals my counsel with ignorance?’ Surely I spoke about things I did not understand,things too wondrous for me to know.You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak. When I question you, you will inform me.’ I had heard reports about you, but now my eyes have seen you. Therefore, I reject my words and am sorry for them; I am dust and ashes” </strong></em>(Job 42: 1-6). Instead of justifying Himself before Job, God reveals the glories of His name and the glories of His creation that He is behind. God doesn’t need to directly show us why certain things happen in our lives. He surely does not owe us an answer or need to justify Himself. Does God, the Author and Provider of life owe us anything? NO. We need to trust in the God who claims to be love and trust that there are certain things only God can comprehend and we need to have faith upon Him. Job came to this conclusion, even though he did not get his answer on why these disastrous events struck his life. Knowing why certain events happen is not guaranteed to provide you with the peace one is seeking. However, Job did find contentment in knowing that God is there, looking out for him, even though it may not feel like it. He found  peace in knowing the glories of God, and coming to the understanding that he cannot possibly digest the thoughts and plans of the Most High, but what He can understand is that there is a God that will always be there, who is all-mighty and great, who is behind the majesty of this world, and who cares and loves for His creation, a God who knows and acts in full righteousness and purity. </p>
<p>The God of the Bible is a just, righteous, pure Creator of His creation. When bad things happen, sometimes there is a clear definite answer. Sometimes it is because we are reaping what we have sown. In other times, only God can truly know.  Sometimes, suffering doesn’t feel right; it doesn’t feel warranted. That is the world we live in. Corrupted by sin. We are not going to understand why everything happens. We need to trust God. For the non-Christian, there will never be a good answer. For those who are believers, however, we can find comfort in knowing that <strong><em>“We know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, who are called according to his purpose”</strong></em>(Romans 8:28). All things will work out for God’s people, those who have chosen to accept the blood of Christ. We know in this world, things may go astray, however, the Christian can hope towards an eternal future of rest and peace in the presence of God.</p>

<h1>Those who never heard</h1>

<p>Man has fallen, as a result, we are condemned by the perfect God because of our sin. This condemnation results in the sentence of hell, an eternity separated from the God of love. This fate is just for God to execute upon mankind as His creation chooses death, sin, and rebellion over God all the time through their actions. We have utterly rejected God, but there is hope. God being the very essence of love developed a way- one way alone- for His creation to be reconciled from their former rebellion.  Jesus Christ bore the complete wage of mankind’s sin upon Himself on the cross, conquered death itself, and rose from the dead! God offers eternal life and salvation to those who accept His gift, to those who have faith upon the resurrected Lamb. 
This is amazing, right? Humanity has fallen into a pit of doom that they have dug themselves; God has then extended His hand to save humanity from their self-inflicting doom. You may be saying to yourself ‘Okay fine, we have sinned and fallen short of this God. God has saved us and we can accept this saving grace by having faith upon the name of Christ. But what about those who never hear the name of Christ or of God? What about the people who live in isolation from the world around, those who live in isolated tribes, who attack and flee from contact from the rest of the world ( ex: Sentelenise tribe- tribesman live on isolated island, territory of India, speak distinct, unknown language, killed missionary after spotting him, no one allowed on island)? Are these people doomed just like those who have rejected the gospel? If they are, how is God just in His condemnation if they haven’t heard of Him?’  This is one, if not the hardest question a Christian may ever have to  answer (*I personally spent countless hours digesting and comprehending Biblical texts and formulating thoughts on issue*). </p>

<p> First and foremost, God is just in condemning the people who have never heard the gospel. Mankind is not doomed because they specifically reject the gospel and Christ, but because man has sinned grievously against God . Those who never heard  are no exception; there is not a single human who is blameless, not one who has not done evil. So, these people do not get a pass because they never heard of Christ, they are justly condemned for their sin. Also, to say they have never heard of God is just not true. God has revealed Himself and His glory through His creation and man’s own conscience (*the Earth testifies and makes known to every single human that there is a Creator. It is obvious that there needed to be a Maker to create and sustain the world in its functions. Everybody also has a conscience, a moral law written on their hearts that testifies against them. We all have gone against what we have known to be right, our conscience testifies to that. If we have a basis of right and wrong engraved into our hearts, then there has to be One who is the Lawgiver. These two truths are  made apparent to all, yet many reject this given truth*). As Apostle Paul writes <strong><em>“For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,  because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened” </strong></em>(Romans 1: 18-21). <strong><em>“So, when Gentiles, who do not by nature have the law, do what the law demands, they are a law to themselves even though they do not have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts. Their consciences confirm this. Their competing thoughts either accuse or even excuse them  on the day when God judges what people have kept secret, according to my gospel through Christ Jesus” </strong></em>(Romans 2: 14-16). God has shown Himself to all, yet the vast majority reject this general revelation. Humanity doesn’t want to believe in the given laws of God, rather, man wants to serve his own desires and seeks after his pleasures, not truth. This is evident in the various religions that have been developed all over the world. These religions are wrong, evil,  and exemplify man’s sin; they show that man serves his own self, making his own god(s) to his liking. These religions testify to the defilement of man and his mind’s corruption, these religions are the very work of Satan’s deception. <strong><em>“‘What profit is an idol when its maker has shaped it, a metal image, a teacher of lies? For its maker trusts in his own creation when he makes speechless idols! Woe to him who says to a wooden thing, Awake; to a silent stone, Arise! Can this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in it’” </strong></em>(Habbakkuk 2: 18-19).</p>
<p>For sake of discussion,  let’s say that the one who has never heard of Christ or any God, accepts the general revelation given to him or her , bows down and cries out to God for mercy, and acknowledges that he or she is a wicked, wretched sinner that needs saving. What happens to these people who are genuine, but do not know the name of Christ and what He has done? Well,  God longs and desires for His people to be saved. Look at what Peter writes: <strong><em>“Dear friends, don’t overlook this one fact: With the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day. The Lord does not delay his promise, as some understand delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance” </strong></em>(2 Peter 3: 8-9). God will find a way to save the one who longs and cries out to Him; He will make the truth known to the one who seeks it.  This is documented in the book of Acts. Cornelius was a God-fearing Gentile man,  a centurion or commander of the Italian Cohort for the Roman Empire. He was a generous man and one who constantly engaged in prayer to God. By all appearances this man was saved: he feared God earnestly, prayed fervently , and gave to those who needed it. Even so, he did not know the name of Christ and was not saved. God had a plan, however, and would make sure Cornelious was put in the position to receive the truth that he has sought after: <strong><em>“About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him, ‘Cornelius.’ And he stared at him in terror and said, ‘What is it, Lord?’ And he said to him, ‘Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.’When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him,  and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa”</strong></em> (Acts 10: 3-5). Cornelius receives a vision from God that gives him orders to call this mysterious man named Peter to come to his house. Cornelius does not know why, but trusts upon God’s revelation and sends for Peter. Peter is also notified by a vision that three men are coming to him. Peter doesn’t know who these men are, but he also trusts in God’s vision, offers hospitality for these men when they come for the night, and then he travels with these men to Cornelious’ estate. When Cornelious meets Peter, he reveals to Peter why he called him . Before we go any further, let’s go back to Peter’s vision. The second part of Peter’s revelation from God is to accept the three men that will be arriving at his house. The first part of Peter’s vision was actually a vision about clean and unclean animals. God, in the vision, told Peter to eat the unclean animal, Peter protested to this, by saying that he has never eaten such a thing (*Jews held fast to their dietary laws, as eating unclean animals made oneself unclean. One ought not to eat such an animal as a Jew. Peter is still holding fast to these beliefs, questions and protests against God’s commands. However, God is revealing a point much greater than clean and unclean foods to Peter. He is showing Peter that salvation is available to Jew [who would be the clean animal in the vision] and Gentile [who would be the unclean animal in the vision] alike. Peter does not come to this realization until meeting with Cornelious*). When Peter hears Cornelious’ side of the story he “<strong><em>opened his mouth and said: ‘Truly I understand that God shows no partiality,  but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all),  you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree,  but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear,  not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name’” </strong></em>(Acts 10: 34-43).  <strong><em>While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word. And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles. For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared, ‘Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?’  And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days” </strong></em>(Acts 10: 44-48). God is able to call Cornelius and his family to the truth through Peter as His vessel. They are now saved, as seen by the work of the Holy Spirit in their lives. This story is a testament to God’s sovereignty and great wisdom. He is able to construct a situation where the one who truly seeks out His name is given the further necessary information that he- and even his family- may be saved, all while teaching and showing Peter that there is salvation to all people, not just for Jews, which results in Peter being able to help and save a multitude of other people whom he would’ve never ministered to if not for this situation. Through this situation, it is established God can use visions and His people to reach the one who has never heard of Christ. In other situations where it may not be possible for the gospel to be spread by a Christian, God can give revelations in the forms of dreams and visions to lead the genuine seeker to the truth.
 In certain Islamic territories, where it is outlawed for professing Christ,  where calling Jesus Lord gets you stoned and killed, there has been countless recording of visions and dreams, revealing to these practicing Muslims that Christ is Savior (*while several of these stories can be discredited as they contradict with the word of God, I do believe that there are some visions and dreams given by the Holy Spirit to these Muslims and others that are leading them to Christ*). These Muslims who are said to be converting, are risking persecutions and being utterly rejected by the society around them, all due to some dream or vision.  They must really be convicted of this dream or vision to leave their former beliefs. I truly believe that some of these dreams and visions are of God, used to lead those who are seeking the truth, to the truth. So, to the one who has never heard the gospel, but is genuinely seeking God, the one who knows that he or she is a sinner, to this one-  I believe- will  be revealed (through people, vision, dream etc…) of the true gospel message, and be saved if they come to the realization that Christ is Lord. </p>
<p>However, as stated previously, almost everyone rejects the general revelation given by God and end up following their own desires and plans for their lives. This is why Jesus commanded His disciples to go out and preach the Good News to everyone and all, so that everyone may hear of the gospel of Christ; the gift that reconciles us back to our Lord! <strong><em>“Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.  Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age’”</strong></em>(Matthew 28: 16-20). </p>
