        <h1>Skepticism</h1>    
        <p>
        Skeptics lay a wide variety of objections to the claims of the New Testament, here are a few: ‘the New Testament documents have not been preserved in their original form and have been corrupted’. ‘The New Testament was written centuries after the time of the supposed events of Jesus’. ‘Jesus surely did not die on the cross and resurrect from the dead’. ‘The apostles made up the miracles of Jesus. And to end it off,  ‘Jesus was a mythical creation of the writers, He was not a real person’. If the skeptic is right about any of their claims, it gives good reason for one to believe that Christianity is a false religion, Christians are believing a lie and devoting their whole lives to Christ in vain. All of their hard labor is for nothing and the Christian is a doomed man. With a matter as important as this, let us see whose beliefs are backed up by science and history; will it be the Christian or the skeptic?
         
        <h1>Manuscript Preservation	</h1>    
        <p>
          One of the claims the skeptic makes is that the New Testament has not been preserved- we cannot possibly know what was first written by the apostles, right? While it is true the autographs - the original writings of the New Testament authors-are not to be in any known human possession, we can be certain the New Testament we have today is an almost identical representation of what was intended to be written by the apostles. We can come to this conclusion thanks to the science of textual criticism. But before we get into that, we need to first discuss how we have any scripture if we do not have the autographs. When the first documents were written by the original writers, scribes and other Christians wanted to copy the Word in order to spread the name of Christ as fast as possible. So, they created manuscripts- copies of the autographs, to disperse the words of Christ to as many people as possible as fast as they could. Over time, these manuscripts were copied to create even more manuscripts so the word of God could be given to even more people: “The copying process started almost immediately. If a Christian businessman from Thyatira visited the church in Rome, and saw a letter from the Apostle Paul that his church didn’t have, he’d make a copy to take home with him. That process would be repeated over and over again, almost without any restrictions” (Sanders). Since this occurred, we can be confident the New Testament wasn’t utterly corrupted by governing institutions or anyone else to fit their agenda: “The very early Christian church was scattered across Europe and North Africa. The evidence from manuscript fragments at this time is that differences in wording were introduced, but the decentralized nature of the church meant that a conspiracy to deliberately doctor the Gospels was impossible. Wholesale editing would have been possible when the church became politically powerful in the fourth century, but enough manuscripts remain from this time to confirm that this didn’t happen – instead a range of different copying errors have been introduced in manuscripts written in different locations”(Bancewicz). As mentioned above, a lot of manuscripts were created: “[The] New Testament possesses the highest number of manuscripts of any book from the ancient world (prior to AD 350)...Currently lists the official number at 5,856 partial and complete manuscript copies written in the Greek language.These include handwritten copies of the New Testament papyri, parchment and lectionaries. If we add to this number more than 18,000 New Testament manuscripts written in other languages (translations) besides Greek, the overall count swells to more than 24,000 New Testament manuscripts! ” (Holden & Stewart). Because of the rate in which these documents were being copied, there were going to be mistakes made by the scribes. However, these errors were mostly insignificant: “Most of the copying mistakes were simple spelling errors, changes in word order, and so on. There are only a few places where these changes affected a whole sentence or more, and there were never any changes that affected doctrine as a result of the copying process”(Sanders). To keep track of the errors that slipped into the manuscripts, textual critics developed the concept of ‘variants’ to analyze the writings:“When a manuscript(s) differs in wording from the base text, the result is known as a ‘variant reading.’ Because of the innumerable times the New Testament has been copied over the last 2,000 years, these variants have crept into the text. Some scholars estimate that 400,000 or more of these variants (errors) exist in the New Testament text…Technically speaking, any deviation from the base accepted text is an error, but the kinds of ‘errors’ represented in the New Testament text are not errors of historical, geographical, spiritual, or scientific fact. Instead, they are rather trivial”(Holden & Stewart).  Here are some examples of the common ‘variants’ found in the earliest manuscripts: “[Not meaningful or viable are] variants that don’t change the meaning of the text and obviously don’t reflect the original reading. For example spelling errors are easy to detect and aren’t original to the text. Or, occasionally a scribe got careless and repeated a word like the scribe who copied Galatians 1:11: ‘For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel the gospel that was preached by me is not man’s gospel.’ These types of variants make up about 75% of all variants (roughly 400,000 variants).[Viable but not meaningful are]variants [that] could reflect the original, but they don’t affect the meaning of the text. Variants of this sort include synonyms, different spellings, changes in word order, and the like. Allow me to offer you a few examples: John 1:6 either reads, ‘There came a man sent from God.’ Or it reads, ‘There came a man sent from the Lord.’ Either could reflect the original, but meaning remains the same.The movable nu is either present or absent in several instances. This variant is equivalent to the English use of the article ‘a’ or ‘an.’ No translation is affected.Sometimes John has two n’s and sometimes it has one n. It can be spelled either way. [Meaningful not viable are] variants [that] would change the meaning of the text, but they obviously don’t reflect the original. For example, most John 1:30 manuscripts reads, ‘after me comes a man.’ One manuscript, however, reads, ‘after me comes air.’... This variant would change the meaning, but it obviously does not reflect the original. The copyists simply left out a letter (ἀήρ vs. ἀνήρ). Of all textual variants, 99% of them fall into these first three categories”(Leasure). After these errors are parsed through, we are left with the meaningful slip-ups: “When all the variants of the New Testament are considered, we are dealing with only 400 to 600 variants that have any effect on the translation of the text. What is more, church historian Phillip Schaff estimated that of the 400 variants that have affected the sense of the passages in the New Testament, only 50 of these are important”(Holden & Stewart). The last 1% of textual variants- those that are meaningful and viable (different interpretations can be attained based on varying manuscripts) -is up to the textual critic to discern. Before we get into the 1%, however, let us go over the science of textual criticism and what has been found in history that makes us so confident we have such an accurate New Testament text. The job of the textual critic is to examine the numerous manuscripts available and consider the various factors concerning the preserved texts (dating, location, outside sources, etc..) in hopes of piecing together something that mirrors the originals. The major manuscripts used to determine texts are part of different ‘families’- the major ones being of Byzantine and Alexanderian descent: “More than 5000 copies, some complete and others partial, of the Greek New Testament. At least 85% of them belong to the Byzantine family’” (Houghton).“Since the early 1800s[,] Greek manuscripts of the New Testament have been discovered that were written much earlier than those in the Byzantine family. These more recently discovered manuscripts are generally grouped into either the Alexandrian family or the Western family… [Textual scholars] teach… that a reading found in manuscripts from more than one of the three families is better than a reading found in manuscripts belonging to one family”(Houghton). One of the most important manuscripts used by textual scholars today is the Codex Vaticanus,  part of the Alexandrian family dating to around 350 A.D: “It contains almost the entire OT, Apocryphal texts, and almost the entire NT (parts of Hebrews and Revelation are missing). Most text scholars regard Vaticanus as the most trustworthy manuscript of the NT'' (Leasure). One may now be asking themselves ‘how did scholars come to the conclusion that the Vaticanus was reliable and not corrupted?’. To answer this question, we can look at the manuscript known as P75 (*P stands for papyri- material manuscript written on*): “This manuscript contains most of Luke and John’s Gospels and dates somewhere between the late second and early third centuries. Discovered in the 1950s, this manuscript made a significant splash in the text criticism world as it closely resembles the fourth century Codex Vaticanus, demonstrating that the copying of early scribes wasn’t as uncontrolled and inaccurate as many previously thought” (Leasure). Another very important codex is Codex Sinaiticus: “The manuscript contains almost all of the (4th century) New Testament and over half of the Old Testament. For the Gospel texts, its reliability is considered second only to the Codex Vaticanus. For Acts, its reliability is equal to the Codex Vaticanus, and for the epistles, its reliability is ranked first”(Mcdowell).  Here are some other fragmentary papyri manuscripts that date all the way back to  the second century which help us validate the accurate transmission of these crucial codicies: “‘P52’... The manuscript fragment was among a group acquired on the Egyptian market in 1920, but not translated until 1934. The fragment contains words from the account of Jesus’ trial before Pilate” (Mcdowell). “The fragment [P52],… [is] dated… from A.D. 100-150, although most scholars today would use a wider date range of the second century in general.  P52 comes from a codex (ie. book form, not a scroll) and contains parts of seven lines from… John 18:31–33 on the front, and parts of seven lines from verses 37–38 on the back” (Windle).“‘P66,’ dating from AD 200 or earlier, contains most of John’s gospel. This codex is just one century removed from the time of the autograph (original text)... ‘P75,’ which scholars date between AD 175 and 225, is the earliest known copy of the Gospel according to the Luke and one of the earliest of the Gospel according to John. The Diatessaron, which means ‘Harmony of Four’ was created by Tatian, a Christian writer in the second century. It combines the four canonical Gospels into a single harmonious narrative. Though Tatian closely followed the wording of the Gospels, he put the verses in a different sequence.The Diatessaron was used as the standard Gospel text in the liturgy of the Syrian Church for two centuries. It has significance as an early manuscript because the remaining copies bear witness to the earlier Gospels. A. Chester Beatty Papyri (AD 200)…Also known as ‘P45,’ ‘P46,’ and ‘P47,’...‘P45’ contains part of a codex of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Acts. ‘P46’ contains letters written by Paul: Romans, Hebrews, I and II Corinthians, Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians, Colossians, and I Thessalonians. ‘P47’ contains the oldest known text of the Book of Revelation” (Mcdowell). Between all of these sources, the textual critic can compare the manuscripts and decipher what was originally written. Now let us go back to the 1% of important textual variants to consider. But before we do that, it is important to note that the 1% that is up in the air has nothing to do with key Christian doctrine. No significant belief of the Christian is impacted or completely based on these unclear passages: “The work of the textual critic has been unnecessary, since the vast majority of textual variants involve minor matters that do not affect doctrine as it relates to one’s salvation. Even those variants that might be deemed doctrinally significant pertain to matters that are treated elsewhere in the Bible where the question of authenticity and originality is unobscured. No feature of Christian doctrine is at stake. As Ewert noted: ‘[V]ariant readings in our manuscripts do not affect any basic teaching of the NT.’”(Miller). Ok, let’s finally look at some examples of the unsure texts of the New Testament: In Luke 22, when Jesus knows that He is about  be handed over to the authorities that will bring Him to His crucifixion, the text could state “(A) it includes Jesus agonizing and sweating drops of blood in the garden, or (B) it omits it.The manuscript evidence is somewhat divided on this issue. Good manuscripts support both A and B, although church father quotations support A” (Leasure). From this, it is probable that the original writing included the depiction of Jesus extremely anxious as it would make no sense for a scribe to make up a false story showing Jesus in this state.  So, we can come to the conclusion that the text of the manuscripts available to us  as a whole- even though there are many variations- are telling the same story for the most part and are a reliable copying of the New Testament that has not been corrupted by any scribe.

        <h1>Church Fathers </h1>    
        <p>
Even with this mountain of evidence from the existing Greek manuscripts, if we were to completely disregard them in our analysis of the reliability of the transmission of the autographs, we would still be able to have confidence in the current text based on other sources. This is thanks to the early church fathers. As Dr. Wallace said in his presentation to Dallas Theological Seminary, the early church fathers quote from the New Testament over one million times! (Wallace). He said this about them:“We can reproduce, virtually, the entire new testament multiple times over from the writings of just the church fathers” (Wallace). Here are some specific early church fathers and what was included in their writings: “ Seven letters have survived that were written by Ignatius (AD 70–110), and nearly every book of the Bible (except 2 John and Jude) was quoted by AD 110 by only three individuals—Ignatius, Clement of Rome, and Polycarp. In those seven letters, Ignatius quoted from 18 different books of the New Testament. Every time he cited Scripture we can observe the Greek text he was using”(Holden & Stewart). Because of this, the early church father writings can help us decipher discrepancies between two manuscripts.

        <h1>Preserved Word
 </h1>    
        <p>
From all of this, we can come to the conclusion that the New Testament text has surely been preserved and what we have in our Bible’s today is very, very close to the autographs. However, the skeptic may not be done just yet: ‘Ok sure, the New Testament text has been preserved, but we only have proof that some of it was written in the second century. Also, there is no way we can prove the disciples who supposedly witnessed the resurrected wrote the text. If they did, how can we prove it was shortly after Christ died? If they wrote decades after He did die, their stories would have surely been distorted’. 

        </p>
         <h1>	The Writers</h1>    
        <p>
          Let us first start off with the topic of the true writers of the gospel. In modern-times, secular historians love to say that we have no clue who wrote the gospels and that the church added titles to the works to give authority to them. However, the earliest followers and enemies of Christ  did not conceive such a doubt in their minds. To start off ,we have Celsus who is a Greek, pagan writer that testifies to the true writers: “the disciples of Jesus, having no undoubted fact on which to rely, devised the fiction that he foreknew everything before it happened…The disciples of Jesus wrote such accounts regarding him, by way of extenuating the charges that told against him”(Celsus, Against the Christians). Celsus, being a pagan Greek, who thinks of the Christian movement as some rebellion to the belief of the Greeks and Romans, obviously will not affirm the miraculous and sovereign nature and works of Christ, hence declaring the works as fictitious. However, in this quotation, we see Celsus state that these so-called false accounts of Jesus were indeed written by his disciples. Celsus may have doubted the writing of the disciples, but he did know who wrote those writings. Adding to this, several very early church fathers (2nd→ 3rd century) affirm the gospel-writers. Here are a few: Irenaus, Papias, Tertullian and Clement. “Now Matthew published among the Hebrew a written gospel also in their own tongue while Peter and Paul were preaching in Rome and founding the church” (Irenaues of Lyons). “And the elder [John] used to say this: ‘Mark, having become Peter’s interpreter, accurately wrote down everything he remembered, though not in order, of the things either said or done by Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor followed him, but afterward, as I said, followed Peter, who adapted his teachings as needed but had no intention of giving an ordered account of the Lord’s sayings. Consequently Mark did nothing wrong in writing down some things as he remembered them, for he made it his one concern not to omit anything that he heard or make any false statements in them ’”(Papias of Hierapolis). “Luke, however, was not an apostle, but only an apostolic man…not a master, but a disciple, and so inferior to a master - at least as far subsequent to him as the apostle [Paul] whom he followed…was subsequent to the others…Even Luke’s form of the Gospel men usually ascribe to Paul ”(Tertullian of Carthage). “Of all those who had been with the Lord only Matthew and John left us their recollections and traditions says that they took to writing perforce…John, it is said, used all the time a message which was not written down, and at last took to writing for the following cause. The three gospels which had been written down before were distributed to all including himself; it is said he welcomed them and testified to their truth but said that there was only lacking to the narrative the account of what was done by Christ at first and at the beginning of preaching…They say accordingly that John was asked to relate in his own gospel the period that passed over in silence by the former evangelist” (Clement of Alexandria). From these various church fathers, we see the unanimous belief in the fact that the disciples of Jesus wrote these gospel accounts (*keep in mind there are several other accounts by other church fathers (Jerome, Eusebius, Origen and Justin Martyr) for each book (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) that testify to a disciple of Jesus writing;  for the sake of time and space, they were not included*). Furthermore, there is no line of evidence that argues against these facts,  that the gospels were originally anonymous. For one, if the early writings were truly anonymous, and the early church tried to add a false label to a writing by putting it  under the name of an apostle or disciple, there would have surely been some division over the truth of the label. As we see in the book of Hebrews (a letter addressed to the Hebrew people on the nature of Jesus; this book has no known author and is an anonymous work), there are various proposals when it comes to who wrote it: “some [ancient manuscripts] say Hebrews was written ‘by Timothy’, others by ‘Paul’. The title of one manuscript even explicitly states that it was written ‘anonymously’! The same thing is true among ancient Christian writers: some early Church writers say Paul wrote Hebrews but didn’t identify himself; others say Hebrews was written by Barnabas, the companion of Paul; and still others say it was written by Clement, the bishop of Rome. In the late second century AD, [mentioned in Eusebius’ work ‘Church history’], Origen of Alexandria simply threw up his hands and declared: ‘As to who wrote the epistle [to the Hebrews]’ only ‘God knows’” (Pitre 21). But when it comes to the Gospels, there is no such discussions; there is a consensus among all in the early church- from the church fathers, to the ancient manuscripts- concerning the true writers of each work, and is only challenged by modern secular scholars. Also, if these so-called anonymous works were given falsely attributed titles, why did the church choose two titles in Mark in Luke, names of men who weren’t even eye-witness testimonies, to give authority to these works? 
        </p>
         <h1>The Dating
	</h1>    
        <p>
          To answer the other  objections, let us look to see when the gospels and epistles were in circulation. Were they written decades, or even centuries after Christ died, or was Christ’s name preached and spread immediately after He died and rose? First, let us look back to the P52 manuscript. As previously mentioned, this is the earliest New Testament manuscript available to us, it dates to around 125 A.D and was found in Egypt.  This is so significant as it shows us that John’s gospel was in circulation by the first century undoubtedly: “From this fragment we can conclude that the gospel was completed before 120 AD because not only did the gospel have to be written, it had to be hand-copied and make its way down from Asia Minor to Egypt”(Zukeran). “No one believes this to be a portion of the original gospel document. In fact, the fragment comes from Egypt. Scholars admit it would have taken several decades for the Gospel to have been written, copied, handed from one community to another, carried across the continent and finally buried in Egypt. This would place the original authorship of the document several decades prior to 125AD”(Wallace). In addition to this manuscript, we can look back to the early church fathers’ writings to provide us with various lines of evidence that Paul’s writings and the gospel accounts were known and completed in the first century: “Further, early church leaders frequently quoted the New Testament's writings in their own works. Clement of Rome, for example, wrote in the late first century and cites many of the Gospels and Paul's writings. A harmony of the four Gospels existed in the second century”(CompellingTruth). “Scholars date the writing of Matthew’s gospel to the late 50’s or early 60’s in the first century.  This is due in part to a comment by the church father Irenaeus that ‘Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying the foundations of the Church.’  John’s gospel is dated to the late first century, after the composition of the other gospels.  Again, Irenaeus, writing near the end of the second century states, ‘Afterward, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at Ephesus in Asia.’Early church history records that John lived the final years of his life in Ephesus, dying as an old man sometime near the end of the first century”(Windle).“In about A.D. 185, Irenaus wrote that the book of revelation was composed, ‘almost in our day, towards the end of Domitian’s reign.’Domitian reigned from A.D. 81-96, which is one of the reasons many scholars believe the book of Revelation was written by the Apostle John sometime in the 90’s ”(Windle). Finally, Paul’s own writings show us that the name of Christ was being spread across the land almost immediately after Christ’s death: “Paul’s epistles were written from 48-60 AD. Paul’s outline of the life of Jesus matches with the gospels. First Corinthians is one of the least disputed books regarding its dating and Paul’s authorship. In chapter 15, Paul summarizes the gospel and reinforces the premise that this is the same gospel preached by the apostles. The creed in verses 3-8 dates back to the very beginning of Christianity. It was a creed Paul probably learned from the Apostles who used it to summarize the gospel message when they taught” (Zukeran). Here are the specific verses in mention: <strong><em>“For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.  Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers and sisters at one time; most of them are still alive, but some have fallen asleep.  Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.  Last of all, as to one born at the wrong time, he also appeared to me”</strong></em>(1 Corinthians 15: 3-8). I make mention of this creed because “the 1 Corinthians 15:3-5 material dates to within three years of Paul's conversion.We know this because Paul truly ‘received’ the creed, and the most parsimonious view is that he received it during his trip to Jerusalem three years after his conversion, when he visited Peter and the Jerusalem church as a whole. While Paul was staying at Peter's house, Paul successfully got 15 days worth of information from him. This creed, which Paul says he ‘received,’ seems to have been formed there by the Jerusalem church, so all the pieces fit together quite remarkably.The material dating to earlier than 3 years after Paul's conversion helps us date the creed to about AD 30 because Paul converted to Christianity in AD 32-33”(BeliefMap). From all of this evidence, we can come to the definite conclusion that the gospel message was preached as soon as the events of Christ’s life occurred and Christ’s disciples wrote these accounts “between the AD 40s-90s” (CompellingTruth). Because we can come to this stance, there would be numerous people during the time of these writings who were eye-witnesses who could easily discredit what the disciples wrote if their written words were found to be false:“The time period between the events and their written record is too short for myths to proliferate. Historian A.N. Sherwin White did a detailed study demonstrating that it takes the passing of two generations for myths to develop. The reason for this is that there needs to be sufficient time for the eyewitnesses to pass from the scene”(Zukeran). Early dating gives us great evidence to believe the gospel writers such as Matthew and John were truly eye-witnesses of the resurrected Chirst, not some random authors who were writing down what they heard from others and claimed to be one of the apostles. Here are some other reasons why early dating is vital: “The closer in date to the event, the more accurate the record. Early dating indicates that eyewitnesses were alive and able to attest to the accuracy of the newly circulating gospels. Apostles often appeal to the witness of the hostile crowd pointing out their knowledge of the facts as well (Acts 2:22, Acts 26:26)”(Zukeran). Here is one of the passages in Zukeran is making mention of:<strong><em> “‘Fellow Israelites, listen to these words: This Jesus of Nazareth was a man attested to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs that God did among you through him, just as you yourselves know’”</strong></em>(Acts 2:22).
        </p>
         <h1>The Standard	</h1>    
        <p>
           The New Testament is by far the most recorded ancient history ever. To prove this, let us compare the textual proof of some of the most common, important ancient histories that are considered true and historical accounts by almost every scholar: “New Testament manuscripts far exceed all others. The writings of Plato include only seven ancient manuscripts with the earliest dating 1300 years after the date of the original text. There are ten copies of the Gallic Wars with the earliest dating 1,000 years after the original writings. The Iliad by Homer contains merely 643 copies”(Zukeran). “We have only two manuscripts of Tacitus’ Histories and Annals, one from the ninth century and one from the eleventh. The History of Thucydides, another well-known ancient work, is dependent upon only eight manuscripts, the oldest of these being dated about A.D. 900 (along with a few papyrus scraps dated at the beginning of the Christian era). And The History of Herodotus finds itself in a similar situation”(Miller). “John Warwick Montgomery comments on the strong bibliographical standing the New Testament enjoys when he says, ‘To be skeptical of the resultant text of the New Testament books is to allow all of classical antiquity to slip into obscurity, for no documents of the ancient period are as well-attested bibliographically as the New Testament’”(Holden & Stewart). Now the skeptic may say ‘Fine, the New Testament has been well preserved, and was written by eye-witnesses of Jesus. What we have today is basically what was written in the first text.  However, even if the original text has been kept, the disciples were clearly wrong in their writings. There is no reasonable historical proof that Jesus performed any miracles, let alone was raised from the dead! Their accounts are probably full of non-historical facts that can be proven wrong.  The disciples must have been deceived- or were trying to deceive others- into the lie that Jesus died and resurrected. ’
        </p>
         <h1>The Gospels: Historical Accounts	</h1>    
        <p>
          To answer the skeptics' objections, let us first deal with the matter of what type of literature the gospels are. Not all the books of the Bible are meant to be taken in the same sense. For example, the Psalms and Proverbs are obviously filled with poetry and do not make claims to be a scientific or historical telling of any sorts, rather they are meant to spread wisdom, knowledge, and insight. So, were the gospels intended to be a true historical account of Christ’s life, or were the gospel writers telling a story that had no historical roots:  a legend or myth, meant to tell a good moral story and not to be taken literally? While there is some dispute among scholars, it is evident from the gospels claims they were written as an ancient biography- a historical telling of the life of Christ.  This is clear as Luke, in the beginning of his gospel, states <strong><em>“many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,  just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,  so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught”</strong></em> (Luke 1: 1-4). The next question we must ask is whether or not the gospels are actually an accurate history of what really happened. There have been numerous objections to the historicity of Luke’s claims in the gospels, leading many scholars to believe the gospel of Luke to be an erroneous, faulty history. One leading scholar, William Ramsey, thought Luke’s gospel account was written hundreds of years after Jesus and was filled with false, made up accounts. He traveled to the Middle East in hopes of confirming his claims with archeological findings. After his travels, Ramsey took a complete 180 in his views, from being an atheist who had a very low regard of the Bible and gospels, to coming to the conclusion that “‘Luke is a historian of the first rank; not merely are his statements of fact trustworthy’ . . . ‘this author should be placed along with the very greatest of historians’”(ChristianPublishingHouse). Critics at the time of Ramsey said that Luke was at fault when he was talking about three cities, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. In his account, Luke separates Iconium  from Lystra and Derbe and calls the latter, cities of Lyconia, implying Iconium was not. This was problematic as Iconium was closer to Lystra than Derbe was, so it would not make any sense for Luke to do so. Even other ancient historians identified Iconium a part of Lyconia, so Luke was surely in error in this account, right? Well, in 1910, as William Ramsey was in the midst of his quest, he discovered “a monument in the ruins of Iconium showing that the language of that city was Phrygian and not Lycaonian… the Iconium of Paul’s day was Phrygian in culture and distinct from ‘the cities of Lycaonia,’ where people spoke ‘in the Lycaonian tongue’”(ChristianPublishingHouse). This finding affirmed that Luke was in fact right in his proclamation. Also, in Acts, Luke uses an odd, unknown word in his account, ‘politarchs’, to describe the rulers of Thessalonica. This was very strange and and led some to be suspicious because this word was never seen in former “Greek literature…[but]  then an arch was found in the ancient city [Thessalonica] containing the names of city rulers described as ‘politarchs’—exactly the word used by Luke” (ChristianPublishingHouse). Finally, at the end of the book of Acts, Paul is in a ship as a prisoner heading to Rome to stand trial before Caesar, but suddenly a huge storm with great winds came over them. From their starting point, the island of Cauda, they were being driven to the northern African coast, but with a change of direction, they crash landed to the island of Malta, traveling around 540 miles. These points  are significant:“Naval experts calculate that it would take a large ship sailing in a gale over 13 days to be driven that far…Luke’s account…states that the shipwreck occurred on the 14th day”(ChristianPublishingHouse). This estimate isn’t a number a person who has no experience of sea navigation could just make up: “yachtsman James Smith concluded: ‘ no man not a sailor could have written a narrative of a sea voyage so consistent in all its parts,unless from an actual observation”’(ChristianPublishingHouse). Overall , Luke, in his writings of ‘the Gospel of Luke’ and ‘Acts’ is known to have cited “32 countries, 54 cities, and 9 islands without error”(Zukeran).  Archaeology points to the fact that Luke is a proven writer who tells an accurate, honest history of the events of the life of Christ and the Acts of the Apostles. The skeptic may now say ‘Luke’s proven accounts are only of historical people, cities, and phrases. Luke could have given an orderly account of the surrounding world so that his tale of Jesus could seem to be grounded in truth.  There is no way something like Jesus’ miracles can be supported by history’.

        <h1>The Context	</h1>    
        <p>
          Before we get into this claim, we need to first understand the historical context during the life of Jesus. Jesus was on this earth from the very beginning of the first century (c. 4 B.C) all the way to 30 A.D. During this time, Israel and the Jewish people were under the oppressive Roman rule- with Tiberius being Emperor during the ministry of Christ. The Roman Empire was massive, so it was split into various provinces. The Judean province-the province of the people of Israel- was ruled by Herod’s family- who were allies of the Emperor-  a Roman prefect named Pontius Pilate, and the high priest Caiphas during Christ’s latter portion of life (Britannica). The gospels document the evil acts of rulers of the Judean province; they show the oppression of their rule, leaving the people helpless to their wicked ways. For example, when King Herod heard that the coming Messiah was to be born, the One who would be king of the Jews , he was startled and had plans to kill this Messiah. However, the men he sent out to retrieve this Messiah baby did not follow Herod’s commands to bring the baby back to him. As a result, in hopes to kill the proclaimed Christ, <strong><em>“he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under”</strong></em>(Matthew 2: 16). For reasons like this the people of Israel despised the government over them:“as God’s chosen people, the Jews felt they should be free both of foreign domination and of ambitious worldly leaders”(Britannica). Because of this, the Jews longed for their Messiah to come and save them. The view of the role of the coming Messiah in 1st century Judaism was very different from what Jesus Christ actually came to do. Jewish belief viewed their Christ as the coming “political Messiah who would deliver them from the iron heel of Roman occupation and oppression”(Levy). The Messiah was never thought to be God made flesh, but “a man with unusual power from God who will manifest the qualities of a prophet, priest, and king in Israel”(Levy).  The Messiah was not explicitly a miracle worker: “miracles were proof neither of divinity nor of messiahship”(Britannica). There was no belief in the Messiah’s resurrection, but there was going to be -in Jewish belief- a general resurrection of all of the dead. The Jewish Savior was thought to bring a period of universal peace and prosperity here on earth, “a descendant of King David who would secure the land of Israel for the Jewish people; bring peace and blessing to Israel and the world; rebuild the Temple on its historical site; and reinstitute the sacrificial system” (Levy). The disciples had faith in Jesus as the coming Messiah: When Jesus asked His disciples who they thought He was, <strong><em>“Simon Peter replied, ‘You are the Christ, the Son of the living God’”</strong></em>(Matthew 16:16). Right after this proclamation, however, Peter rebukes Jesus for saying the Christ must suffer: <strong><em>“Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.  And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, ‘Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you.’ But he turned and said to Peter, ‘Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man’”</strong></em>(Matthew 16: 21-23). This shows that the disciples themselves- being Jews- had the expectation that Christ should bring His kingdom here on earth and that Christ would free the people of Israel from the hand of the Romans. They did not understand what Christ had in store; it differed from anything they had ever conceived in their minds. Keeping these points in mind, the miracles documented in the gospels would have not been a result of the disciples trying to make Jesus some sort of Messianic figure; as discussed previously, that was not required of Christ. So, why did the writers of the gospel tell of Jesus’ miracles? The most likely conclusion is that they were giving a true, honest account. 
        </p>
        <h1>The Miracles	</h1>    
        <p>
          The first piece of evidence to support the truth of Jesus’ miracles comes from the Bible itself. The gospels are 4 different accounts of the life of Christ, some miracles told are unique to that book -as each writer has a different perspective of the events of Jesus’ life- yet there are some miracles that are unanimously documented in the gospel accounts. For example, all four of the gospel accounts make reference to Jesus’ feeding of the 5,000 people. To further support the sincere, accurate documentation of these affairs, the gospel writers received word from eye-witnesses, or were themselves eye-witnesses to these miraculous events. In Peter’s epistle, he makes this exact assertion: <strong><em>“For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, ‘This is my beloved Son,with whom I am well pleased’  we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain”</strong></em>(2 Peter 1: 16-18).  (The miracle Peter is making note of is the transfiguration- where they-Peter, James,  and John-saw a couple of well-known righteous men of God-figures such as Elijah and Moses on a mountain. Then, when they looked at Jesus' face, He was transformed into this great radiant, white, figure, when they suddenly heard God’s voice proclaiming the Son). We can take Peter’s testimony a couple different ways: he is telling the truth, he is a crazed man who was hallucinating, or he is a liar. The second option is automatically invalid as this event was mentioned by Matthew and Luke’s account and Peter was with two other people to discuss the matter with (*see more: Resurrection [Mass Hallucinations] *).  Peter was not seeing or hearing things. This now leaves us with two options. The latter is nonsensical- as already established, miracles are not required of the Messiah; the disciples have no motive to lie. These accounts are trustworthy- as established above- and should be taken as historical.  However, if one still chooses not to consider the validity of the gospels, there is an abundance of documentation from external sources concerning Christ’ life and miracle powers (*we must keep in mind, however, that there will not be as much detail in the external sources and that should not be expected. We are not going to find external documentation of miracles like the feeding of the five thousand as these sources are obviously not eyewitness accounts of Christ, but we will find evidence that should lead us to believe that the feeding did occur*). One to be aware of before we dive into the external documentation is that Christ was alive in the ancient period of history. Ancient histories which wrote about Jesus have been lost over time, so all that remains of some of  these historians’ works are “[quotations] by other authors in antiquity. This is not a problem for the historian, as many works have been preserved in the quotations of other ancient writers”(Windle). Now that we have established this, we can start looking at the external evidence for Christ. In his work, ‘The True Doctrine’, Celsus, the Greek philosopher who was alive around 170 A.D makes note of Jesus’ life in his writings (* we do not have Celsus’ original work, but we do have quotation of Origen, who was a historian who wrote 70 years after Celsus in his work ‘Rebutting Celsus’ *). Celsus states that the virgin birth is a fallacy, and that Jesus was “born in a certain Jewish village, of a poor woman of the country, who gained her subsistence by spinning, and who was turned out of doors by her husband, a carpenter by trade, because she was convicted of adultery; that after being driven away by her husband, and wandering about for a time, she disgracefully gave birth to Jesus, an illegitimate child, who having hired himself out as a servant in Egypt on account of his poverty, and having there acquired some miraculous powers, on which the Egyptians greatly pride themselves, returned to his own country, highly elated on account of them, and by means of these proclaimed himself a God’”(Celsus in ‘The True Doctrine’). From this we see that the critical, pagan historian affirms that Jesus was born of Mary, that He possessed some kind of miraculous powers, and claimed the title of God. He cannot possibly believe in the root of the power of Christ and His authoritative claims, so Celsus chalks up the life of Jesus to naturalistic explanations like Mary being an adulterer. A similar documentation of Christ’s life comes from the Talmud. The Talmud is an ancient oral history that was then made into print after being passed on for centuries: “Judaism has an ‘Oral Torah’ which is a tradition explaining what these scriptures mean and how to interpret them and apply the laws. Orthodox Jews believe God taught this Oral Torah to Moses, and to others, down to the present day. This tradition was maintained only in oral form until about the 2nd century A.D., when the oral law was compiled and written down in a document called the Mishnah. Over the next few centuries, additional commentaries elaborating on the Mishnah were written down in Jerusalem and Babylon. These additional commentaries are known as the Gemara. The Gemara and the Mishnah together are known as the Talmud. This was completed in the 5th century A.D.” (GotQuestions). In the Talmud, it makes mention of Jesus as being a sorcerer and a man who practiced dark magic, who performed miraculous feats from His powers acquired from Egypt. “Jesus was a magician and a fool. Mary was an adulteress” (Shabbath 104B, Babylonian Talmud). “Jesus [“Yeshu” in the Talmud] stood up a brick to symbolize an idol and bowed down to it. Jesus performed magic and incited the people of Israel and led them astray”(Sanhedrin 107B, Babylonian Talmud).“On Passover Eve they hanged Jesus [“Yeshu” in the Talmud] of Nazareth. He practiced sorcery, incited and led Israel astray…. Was Jesus of Nazareth deserving of a search for an argument in his favor? He was an enticer and the Torah says, ‘You shall not spare, nor shall you conceal him!’”(Sanhedrin 43A, Babylonian Talmud). From these claims we know that the Jews regarded the crucifixion as historical  and those who despised Jesus thought of Him as One who did miracles, but by the dark, satanic powers, leading the people of Israel away from the Father. This is a direct parallel to what some of the witnesses of Christ’ miracles thought as well: <strong><em>“Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the people marveled. But some of them said, ‘He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons’”</strong></em>(Luke 11: 14-15). From all of these sources, we can undoubtedly affirm that Jesus performed spectacular works- from the internal evidence, to the critical external evidence, Christ’s miracles are historical.  Due to this mountain of evidence, even modern, secular historians agree that Jesus was a healer. As stated previously in the article, allotting Jesus’ works to legendary alteration cannot be a plausible solution as legends take time to develop because there would be numerous eye-witness accounts that would either confirm or deny the powers of Christ. “Jesus was a very public figure. When Jesus entered a town in Israel, he often drew large crowds of people. Thus it is unlikely that within and around the province of Israel that many glaring misrepresentations of Jesus’ life could have originated and spread within one or two generations after his death since many eye witnesses would have still been alive to contest these gross inaccuracies.  Scholars believe that these eyewitnesses were the source of the oral tradition regarding Jesus’ life. And in light of Jesus’ very public ministry, a strong oral tradition would likely have been present in Israel for many years after Jesus’ death. If Jesus never actually performed any miracles, then the Gospel writers would have faced a very difficult task in getting significant numbers of people to believe that he had”(Gleghorn). However, secular historians would never believe in something supernatural like miracles could ever occur, so they take the route of believing that Jesus “only healed psychosomatic maladies” (Gleghorn). When a person is under an immense amount of pressure and is so grieved, their own mind can strike illness-like symptoms upon their own physical body: “Conversion disorders afflict approximately fourteen to twenty-two out of every 100,000 people. Conversion disorders are psychosomatic problems in which intense emotional trauma results in blindness, paralysis, deafness, and other baffling impairments”(Gleghorn). “Many infections and even cancers are naturally healed by the body’s own immune system.  And scientists have long known about faith’s amazing curative effect called the placebo effect.  Thus secular historians believe that Jesus’ effectiveness as a healer, like that of many faith healers today, can be explained naturalistically by the curative effects of faith in concert with the subjects’ own natural ability to heal and fight off infections”(Gleghorn).  However, coming to these conclusions is a massive stretch. As stated above, these very rare disorders only occur in a very small fraction of people. Jesus has healed hundreds of people and performed miracles to thousands upon thousands. It would be illogical to believe that Christ’s healings- which were said to be instantaneous, keep in mind- were all due to the fact that the people believed in Jesus, and by their own strength and bodily power, were healed.

        <h1>Crucifixion & Resurrection 	</h1>    
        <p>
          We can be sure that Christ performed miracles, but can His greatest work be supported by history? Is it historically plausible that Jesus Christ died and resurrected? There are many objections to this two-part claim. A route many Muslims take is to believe that Jesus did not die on the cross, but was likely replaced by His betrayer, Judas. Secular historians have the belief that Jesus did die on the cross, but was surely not raised from the dead. Finally, the Christian believes in both parts of the claim: Christ has died and risen. So, who is right? The first claim we need to address is the crucifixion. All four gospel accounts say that Jesus was delivered to be crucified: <strong><em>“When daybreak came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put him to death. After tying him up, they led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor”</strong></em> (Matthew 27:1-2). If this is not enough for you, there is a great abundance of extra-biblical sources that note the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Lucian of Samosata was a Greek satirist, and in his work ‘The Death of Peregrine’-written around 165 A.D- he makes note of these strange people: “the Christians, you know, worship a man to this day,–the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account…. You see, these misguided creatures start with the general conviction that they are immortal for all time, which explains the contempt of death and voluntary self-devotion which are so common among them; and then it was impressed on them by their original lawgiver that they are all brothers, from the moment that they are converted, and deny the gods of Greece, and worship the crucified sage, and live after his laws” (Lucian in ‘The Death of Peregrine’). Lucian affirms that this sage, who the Christains worship and are willing to die for, has been crucified. He finds great folly in these Christians who are willing to reject everything, even their own lives for the name of this Christ figure who has been put to death. Another account of the crucifixion of Christ comes from a man by the name Mara bar Serepion. Mara bar Serapion wrote a letter -that can be dated anywhere between 73 A.D to the 200’s A.D-  to his son when the Romans invaded his home city and was put to prison. He wanted to write a letter to encourage his son in the midst of the persecutions and difficult times. He gives examples of those who were persecuted,  mentioning the likes of Socrates, Pythagorean and ‘The Wise King’ as very noble men who were persecuted and died for their teachings and beliefs and how their words lived on after their deaths: “What else can we say, when the wise are forcibly dragged off by tyrants, their wisdom is captured by insults, and their minds are oppressed and without defense? What advantage did the Athenians gain by murdering Socrates, for which they were repaid with famine and pestilence? Or the people of Samos by the burning of Pythagoras, because their country was completely covered in sand in just one hour? Or the Jews by killing their wise king, because their kingdom was taken away at that very time? God justly repaid the wisdom of these three men: the Athenians died of famine; the Samians were completely overwhelmed by the sea; and the Jews, desolate and driven from their own kingdom, are scattered through every nation. Socrates is not dead, because of Plato; neither is Pythagoras, because of the statue of Juno; nor is the wise king, because of the new laws he laid down”(Mara ban Serapion). In this, Mara bar Serapion affirms that Christ was put to death-just like Socrates and Pythagoras were- by the influence of the Jews, and had a following of believers who let His words live on after His death. The documentation also makes reference to the desolation and dispersion of the Jews, which is historically affirmed as in 70 A.D, the Romans came and took from those living in Judea“their kingdom”, where the Jewish people“suffered the destruction of both Jerusalem and the Temple” (Ramelli).  Finally, towards the end of the first century A.D, a man by the name Josephus, the Jewish-Roman historian takes note of Jesus in his work ‘Antiquity of the Jews’ (*we must take note that the Greek version we have has almost certainly been altered by Christian influence as it proclaims Jesus as Christ and very highly. Josephus would never do this as he was a Jew and not a Christian.  However, we do have Arabic version found very recently that does not include any Christian bias, which scholars and historians look to as an authentic representation of Josephus’ words*): “At this time there was a wise man who was called Jesus. His conduct was good, and [he] was known to be virtuous. And many people from among the Jews and the other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. But those who had become his disciples did not abandon his discipleship. They reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion, and that he was alive; accordingly he was perhaps the Messiah concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders”(Josephus in ‘Antiquity of the Jews’). This account clearly represents that Jesus was crucified and yet this man who claimed the title of Christ still had a strong following after His death. This document also supports the historicity of the gospels because Josephus makes mention of Pilate condemning Christ to the cross as all the gospels do as well.  From this evidence, even unbelievers cannot deny the truth of the crucifixion:“John Dominic Crossan, non-Christian critical scholar and co-founder of the Jesus Seminar, states, ‘That  [Jesus’ crucifixion] is as sure as anything historical can ever be’”(Brake). Moving on, the events surrounding the crucifixion and burial can be supported by the many shameful moments recorded in the gospels. As mentioned previously, the gospel takes note of Jesus rebuking Peter and even allotting his words to be Satan’s (Matthew 16:21-23). Also noted in the gospels is the constant ignorance and unknowingness of the apostles when Jesus is talking about His deliverance: <strong><em> “They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know, for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, ‘The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.’ But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him”</strong></em> (Mark 9: 30-32). Then, when Jesus was delivered to the high priest's house after Judas betrayed Him, Peter openly denies Jesus several times: <strong><em>“Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house, and Peter was following at a distance. And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, ‘This man also was with him.’ But he denied it, saying, ‘Woman, I do not know him.’ And a little later someone else saw him and said, ‘You also are one of them.’ But Peter said, ‘Man, I am not.’ And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, ‘Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.’  But Peter said, ‘Man, I do not know what you are talking about.’ And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed. And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, ‘Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.’And he went out and wept bitterly”</strong></em>(Luke 22: 54-62). Later on, after Jesus has been killed, all four of the gospels write about Joseph of Aremithia. Joseph is the one who took Jesus’ body and gave Him a proper burial. This is almost certainly not a creation of the gospel-writers' minds as Joseph was “a part of the Council, or Sanhedrin—the group of Jewish religious leaders who called for Jesus’crucifixion”(GotQuestions). It would make zero sense for the disciples to make up a story that  gives honor and credit to Joseph -one who was a part of the same group as those who delivered their Messiah to death: “the creation…of a sympathizer from among their number would be surprising; and ‘Arimathea, ‘a town very difficult to identify and reminiscent of no scriptural symbolism, makes a thesis of invention even more implausible’”(Brake). Finally, when the women go to visit the tomb to put spices on Jesus’ body, they are met with an empty casket surrounded with angels of God. Considering the culture and place of these events, where women’s testimonies were regarded so low and insignificant that they sayings “were not even permitted to serve as legal witnesses in a court of law” (Craig). To say the least, this was not an event from the disciples' imagination; the women were the first witnesses and testimony of the risen Christ!  If the disciples were lying about the events concerning Christ and were just spreading the tale of Jesus rising, why would they document their failures and present themselves and the events in such a manner? If it were a lie, wouldn't they want to glorify themselves and make the story appealing to those who would hear? Instead, they document some of the most humiliating events about themselves that now testify to us of the validity and honesty of the gospels, even in the crucifixion and burial account. The last piece of the puzzle is the resurrection account. One of the greatest testimonies to Jesus’ resurrection is His empty tomb. We can be absolutely sure that “something happened to the body of Jesus”(Brake). It is historically proven that Christ was publicly crucified and killed. After this occurred, we know that Joseph buried Him in his tomb. So, everyone knows exactly where the body of Jesus would be. </p>
          
          <p>When the tomb was found empty by the women, the first thing the chief priests and guards did was not to display the body of Jesus, but to blame it on the disciples, saying that they stole it: <strong><em>“While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place. And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers and said, ‘Tell people, ‘His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.’ And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.’ So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day”</strong></em>(Matthew 28:11-15). This clearly shows us the body of Jesus was gone from the tomb; the guards and soldiers could have easily brought down the tale of the disciples by showing everyone the dead corpse. However, there was nothing to show, so they resorted to making up a story that the disciples came and stole the body. The disciples would have never done this for several reasons: a resurrected Messiah was never a thought in their mind , and no one would suffer or die for something they knew to be false. To add to this, there are several eye-witnesses to the resurrected Christ. As you may remember, in 1 Corinthians 15, Paul cites a Christian creed that was used less than five years after Jesus died. In this creed, it testifies that Christ appeared to Peter, the rest of the apostles, and then to five hundred people. As previously noted, there was no time for legendary embellishment to influence this account, it is way too close to the events: “Paul was converted in AD 33, this means that the list of witnesses goes back to within the first five years after Jesus' death. Thus, it is idle to dismiss these appearances as legendary. We can try to explain them away as hallucinations if we wish, but we cannot deny they occurred. Paul's information makes it certain that on separate occasions various individuals and groups saw Jesus alive from the dead” (Craig). Hallucinations, as mentioned previously, are illogical and are not a sensical conclusion to what happened. All of the gospels make mention of  post-mortem appearances of Jesus that align with the creed. For example,  found in Luke’s account is one of the sightings of Jesus: <strong><em>“As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, ‘Peace to you!’  But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. And he said to them, ‘Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.’ And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.  And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, ‘Have you anything here to eat?’ They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate before them”</strong></em>(Luke 24: 36-42). Luke’s account also shows the doubts and ignorance of the disciples. Earlier in the article, we made mention of the 1st century Jewish views of the Messiah to come; the disciples probably held views similar to these. Even though Jesus was constantly prophesying the resurrection, the disciples did not understand. The Jewish belief was that there was going to be a resurrection of everyone who was righteous and everyone who followed God at the end of time. The concept of a single man being raised for the sake of humanity's eventual resurrection, and that man was to be God made flesh did not graze any 1st century Jewish mind. Because of this, the disciples, when first hearing the resurrection accounts, were very skeptical: “the women went and told the disciples that they had seen the risen Lord, the disciples did not believe them; after all, the dead do not rise.It wasn’t just the testimony of the women that was not believed, Mark tells us that two disciples saw Jesus when they were walking in the country, but the other disciples still would not believe them”(Haines). However, after the disciples took witness to Jesus’ resurrected body- as seen in Luke- something changed within them. They now understood who Jesus was, what He did, and what His prophecies meant. Because of this, their lives were completely transformed. These once cowardly disciples became some of the bravest, most courageous people on Earth. As previously mentioned, Peter is known to have denied the name of Jesus three times before He was sent to the cross, not wanting to be associated and face legal trouble with this so-called blasphemer Jesus. However, in the book of Acts, we see a complete 180 in Peter. When Peter and John are proclaiming the gospel to the people, <strong><em>“the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.  And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.  But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem, with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, ‘By what power or by what name did you do this?’ Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, ‘Rulers of the people and elders, if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by him this man is standing before you well. This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men  by which we must be saved’”</strong></em>(Acts 4: 1-12).  From this exertion, we see that this Peter, who once trembled and feared the authorities questioning his relation to Jesus, was now proudly proclaiming to them this Jesus to be Lord, and even further stating that He is the means to salvation! Peter was in opposition to these authorities and now willing to be jailed for Christ (*Also important to note is that Peter is believed to have died as a martyr. Church tradition says that he died on an upside down cross*). Later on in Acts- one of the twelve apostles- James, the son of Zebedee died for the faith: <strong><em>“About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church. He killed James the brother of John with the sword, and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread”</strong></em> (Acts 12: 1-3). Finally, we have James, the half-brother of Jesus. James, at first, was not a follower of Jesus or His teachings in any way. Towards the beginning of Jesus’ ministry, His brothers were very skeptical of Jesus and did not have much belief in the wondrous works He supposedly performed: <strong><em>“Now the Jews' Feast of Booths was at hand. So his brothers said to him, ‘Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing. For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.’ For not even his brothers believed in him”</strong></em>(John 7:2-5). However, after the resurrected Jesus appeared to James-mentioned in the 1 Corinthians 15 creed- James believed. He became the leader of the Jerusalem church and  wrote an epistle concerning Christian living. He devoted his whole life to a claim he once found ridiculous. Josephus tells us that James even died for the name of His brother: “And now Caesar, upon hearing the death of Festus, sent Albinus into Judea, as procurator. But the king deprived Joseph of the high priesthood and bestowed the succession to that dignity on the son of Ananus, who was also himself called Ananus ... But this younger Ananus was a bold man in his temper, and very insolent; he was also of the sect of the Sadducees, who are very rigid in judging offenders, above all the rest of the Jews ... Ananus was of this thought he had now a proper opportunity (to exercise his authority). Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the Sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others, and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned” (Josephus in ‘Antiquities’, 20. 9). This devotion and fervor is unlike any other! Sure, there have been others wholly devoted to their religious beliefs, but all other martyrs gave themselves up for the claim that they have heard; a claim that was passed on to them. These followers of Jesus were eye-witnesses. If they were making up the resurrection appearances, then they chose to live a life outcast from their societies; a life of pain, suffering, and death all for the sake of a lie. As the saying goes, “liars make poor martyrs” (Brake). Surely these men had to experience something; it is certain that these disciples of Christ were convinced that Jesus had appeared to them after His death; nothing else would garner such a change. Because of this, the name of Christ spread over the globe. Within a couple of years, Jesus’ name spread to Africa, Asia, and Europe. The churches all around withstood persecutions and oppression. They were built upon the rock-solid foundation of Christ. There was nothing that was going to bring down these early followings:“Luke Johnson, a New Testament scholar at Emory University, muses, ‘Some sort of powerful, transformative experience is required to generate the sort of movement earliest Christianity was’”(Craig, Erhman).Considering all of these facts, there have been various opposing theories that have been presented to naturalistically explain the resurrection account. However, each of these theories  fall flat when held up to history. For example, one popular theory is the Swoon theory. This theory states that Jesus somehow survived the crucifixion and then later appeared to His disciples. This could have not possibly happened as there have been zero instances where any prisoner has survived a full Roman crucifixion. And even if Jesus miraculously survived, there is no way the disciples would have worshiped Jesus as Christ and God considering the defilement and utter destruction of His body that would have left Jesus as a walking corpse. The disciples were transformed by the sight of a powerful  Christ, who was resurrected in a glorious body of life,  not one on the brink of death. Another popular theory is the Hallucination theory where all of the witnesses of Jesus were hallucinating a figure of Jesus simultaneously. This surely did not happen, for reasons mentioned above, the empty tomb, the expectations of 1st century Jews of the Messiah,  and for reasons in ‘The Resurrection (Hallucinations)’. Finally, some hold to the belief that Christianity is a tale that finds its roots in pagan belief systems, where Jesus was a made up person.  For one, it does not explain the numerous regards to Jesus in historical accounts and why there are professed eye-witnesses of Jesus, like James, who are dying for the known tale. Also, it does not account for the historical context of the biblical writers: “all of our sources of information about the pagan religions alleged to have influenced early Christianity are dated very late. We frequently find writers quoting from documents written 300 years later than Paul in efforts to produce ideas that allegedly influenced Paul”(Nash), “the earliest account of a dying and rising god that somewhat parallels Jesus’ resurrection appears at least 100 years later”(Brake), “Paul was grounded on events that actually happened in history”(Nash). This is why many non-Christian scholars stay away from speculating about the issue of what happened. Bart Erhman, a UNC Chapel Hill New Testament professor,  for example, stays agnostic about the resurrection and tells his students to do the same as well. He does not know why or how the things concerning the resurrection of Jesus happened, but he cannot bring himself to believe in it, even if it is backed by the historical facts. He believes that historians cannot use the supernatural to explain historical events in any circumstance.  In a debate between William Lane Craig and Bart Erham, Erhamn introduces his stance with the assertion “miracles are not impossible. I won’t say they’re impossible. You might think they are impossible and, if you do think so, then you’re going to agree with my argument even more than I’m going to agree with my argument. I’m just going to say that miracles are so highly improbable that they’re the least possible occurrence in any given instance. They violate the way nature naturally works. They are so highly improbable, their probability is infinitesimally remote, that we call them miracles. No one on the face of this Earth can walk on lukewarm water. What are the chances that one of us could do it? Well, none of us can, so let’s say the chances are one in ten billion. Well, suppose somebody can. Well, given the chances are one in ten billion, but, in fact, none of us can”(Craig, Erhman). All the evidence points towards the resurrection, but could it possibly have occurred? Could it be that Jesus was truly Christ and resurrected? Can a historical event be explained by such a miracle?
