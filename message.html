        <h1>The Fall</h1>    
        <p>
        The garden of Eden, where man was first deceived: <strong><em>“But the serpent said to the woman, ‘You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil’”</strong></em> (Genesis 3:4-5) .The garden of Eden, where man first rebelled: <strong><em>“So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate”</strong></em> (Genesis 3:6). From the Creation, we-mankind- have been tempted by our own fleshly desires and the evil forces at hand.  In these temptations, we always have a choice: say yes to the temptation; say yes to the will of God. We almost always choose the former. God allows us to do this, being that He has endowed us with free will. He does not force us to submit to what He knows is right and good. However, what we never consider in our decisions is what we will reap. We are so near-sighted, we are blind to the path of eternal damnation we are walking on; the path the Father tried to save us from; the path we are now chained to. 
          <p>
	Adam and Eve (*addressed as Man); the paradigm. After God created Heaven & Earth in all its beauty and splendor, He gave Man free reign and authority over the magnificent nature. Man was free to do as he wished, so long as he abstained from one tree; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The purpose of God’s decrees is to protect His people from corruption and evil,  and to guide His people onto the righteous, joyful, fulfilling path of life, which is exactly what God’s first order to man was doing. However, even after knowing the motive and reasoning of the law of God, Man was still tempted. Man was instantly convinced by the hearing of a word from a mysterious, unreliable source that God was wrong in His command and that the tree He called abstention from, was actually a tree that granted great power and was beneficial. Man, being swayed in his thoughts as the midnight tide, committed the grievous act; he ate the forbidden fruit. Man saw the first sight of more power for himself and jumped right onto it, forsaking the fact that he already had all the power he could have asked for- quite literally having dominion over the full nature of the world. Man’s unfounded, idiotic action reaped grave consequences that he did not process. Because of the partaking of his own foolish desires and passions, Man’s life was transformed from utter bliss, everlastingness, and constant love and affection from God, to a life full of hardship, difficulty, pain and death. Man now faced a life with barriers separating him from experiencing the full nature and glory of God. This sentence was not temporary; as long as the Earth is rotating, Man was left with the fate of grievous toiling over the land in his limited life under the stress and anxiety which was all caused by the first rebellion. By entertaining the temptations presented to him and putting no thought to his ways, Man was now left to himself.  He now knows of evil and is faced with a life of sin, hatred, and emptiness. This terminal, gushing wound of condemnation on Man was self-inflicted. He is left helpless; he is stuck; he is doomed to Hades: <strong><em>“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God”</strong></em> (Romans 3:23).
        </p>
        <p>
	However, there was still hope; God had a plan.  Because the Father loves His people, He gave us a way to come back to Him even after we had chosen the very thing He warned against and despised; there would be a path to salvation. 

        </p>
        <h1>	The Forecast of Salvation </h1>    
        <p>
          From the initial sin of humanity,  God employed several men and women to tell of the One who would save mankind. One of these men being Isaiah- a prophet of God during 8th century B.C; the messenger concerning the Messiah. Through Isaiah, the Father revealed how He would reconcile us through His Anointed One: <strong><em>“With his wounds we are healed” </strong></em>(Isaiah 53:5).
        </p>
        <h1>	The Arrival </h1>    
        <p>
800 years later; the Savior has arrived. From the beginning of His time on Earth, Jesus’ life was sought out by the worldly powers. Take for instance King Herod: After hearing of the birth of this so-called ‘King of the Jews’, Herod sent for the baby to be put to death as he did not want his power to be threatened. However, any Earthly attempt at killing Christ was futile to say the least. In the situation with Herod, God is able to guide Joseph-Jesus’ father- to escape their homeland and flee to Egypt, away from the murderous hand of the king. Jesus’ life was saved and death was averted. Then, around 30 years later, after Jesus’ ministry began, He gained quite a great following of those who despised Him. They made countless efforts to kill and rid the Lord from their land. Take for instance the Pharisees, people who took their own traditions to the authority of God’s, and despised Jesus’ for defying their customs. These Pharisees- in several circumstances- <strong><em>“were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus”</strong></em> (Luke 6:11). Even in Jesus’ hometown of Nazareth, an instance occurred where the people <strong><em>“rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff” </strong></em>(Luke 4:29). Every one of these attempts to kill Jesus failed as it was not ordered by God. Jesus, being God Himself, was not under the subjection or will of man. No matter how much he desired; no matter how valiant his efforts were, mankind could not touch God.
        </p>
        <h1>The Crucifixion </h1>    
        <p>
          Nevertheless, it was the will of God for Christ to die. Jesus, subjecting Himself to the Father’s will, would let man do what he yearned to. Delivered up to the Roman guard, Jesus suffered the death of the murderer, the rapist, and the blasphemer. He was treated as the scum of the Earth. He took upon Himself the unbearable whippings and floggings of the agonizing Roman Crucifixion-where the very skin of His flesh was torn apart, piece by piece-all while enduring the public shame of being naked and exposed for everyone to see. Adding to this, everyone- even the crucified prisoners next to Him- were ridiculing Him concerning His claims of authority: <strong><em>“‘Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!’” </strong></em>(Luke 23: 39). This suffering was due to the sins of humanity. This is the death we deserved; the death the blameless Lamb took upon Himself. 
        </p>
        <h1>The Resurrection</h1>    
        <p>
          Jesus, now buried in Joseph of Arimathea's tomb, was dead. His disciples saw that their lives were all but lost; they were without their Teacher. However, Jesus rose again. It was one thing for Jesus to make claims that He would save the world, be King, and bring  atoning salvation to the world while He was on the Earth; anyone could say that. But since Jesus Christ defeated death itself, His words have the highest authority. It showed that He truly had power and control over the very laws of the Earth, defying the natural order that dictates all human life. If Jesus could raise His own body up from the grave, this means He has great power; the ability to perform what He promised to do; the power to take away the sin of mankind. 
        </p>
        <p>
          With Christ risen, His disciples were abounding with joy. Throughout His ministry, Jesus time after time, told His followers His plans to save God’s people from the world. Now, after Jesus appeared in His resurrected form,  He was able to fully reveal to His apostles the significance of His death- rebirth for all. As Christ died and rose, His followers likewise are able to die to their former life of sin, treachery, sensuality, and temporary stimulation and pleasure and become a new creation in Christ with  a life rooted in God: a life set apart from the ways of the world; a life of eternal fulfillment and hope.
        </p>
        <h1>The Commission </h1>    
        <p>
           The journey of the Christian on this Earth does not end when he confesses Jesus and is sealed with the salvation of God, rather it is just the beginning. Jesus ordered all who believe to walk in this decree: <strong><em>“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,  teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you’”</strong></em> (Matthew 28:19-20). Jesus calls His people to go out and spread His name. This call is so great because it is the only one that saves. Nothing else will satisfy the great burden of sin we have heaped upon ourselves except the great suffering and blood of God Himself. Nothing else. 
        </p>
        <h1>The Purpose </h1>    
        <p>
This is why I have written here today: To one- reveal to you the secret faith I have kept from you these past three or so years,  and two- to tell you of the true saving work of Jesus Christ; the work that I hope upon and have given my life to. The hope I know to be true.
